### Backend
[ ] Clearly define what's an update and what's a tool action in the backend, so that it can be used with more flexibility without changing frontend
[ ] Deep research should have a step in which it decides if the question can be answered or it should continue researching.
[ ] Unify Deep research and reasonSearch
[ ] Add manus-like plan as a document


[x] Create a button to Deep Research


### Frontend
[ ] Annotations for search should be less granular, just a list of sites (like perplexity)


### System
[x] Get rid of API keys, just use the backend keys
[ ] TBD Create limits per accounts with a few credits
